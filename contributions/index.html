### For Noob Front-end Engineers You write code in HTML & CSS. To contribute
you’ll have to use Tailwind. Learn it from the Resources section. How to
Contribute - 1. Create a Branch from Development and name it
feature/YOUR_NAME**-**TASK_NUMBER. For ex. **feature/sachin-13** 2. You’ll
create a file(HTML) with your task number & your name as TASK_NUMBER-YOUR_NAME.
For ex. **13-Sachin.html** 3. **Don’t use any 3rd Party tools like Bootstrap or
Material. They can’t be integrated into our code. Use HTML & Tailwind.** 4.
Create a Pull Request from Your Branch to Development. You can request people to
Review your PRs. 5. Once your PR gets reviewed, Fix the comments if any and
it’ll get merged. 6. Now Once your contribution is accepted, We’ll add these
details to an Excel sheet. 7. …And Your First Contribution is done.
